              Hi user ðŸ‘‹! I'm Viola, a problem-solver and a software engineer.

              <span>&#10240;My passion and expertise are in designing sophisticated systems with limiting constraints.
              {/*I post in my blog regularly on tech things I'm intrigued to share my knowledge about.*/}
              On this page you'll read about my approach, tools, challenges, and how I overcome them.
              In my spare time, I enjoy scuba diving, I'm a PADI-certified pro Divemaster.
                  I like being a mentor to fellow engineers and bring value with my experience.</span>
            </h1>

              <p>Most of my career I spent doing Frontend Engineering and solving problems, no matter how small or big.</p>
              <p>My favourite tools are teh ones I use to build EDA (event-driven architecture), which include but not limited to AWS Lambdas, EC2, RDS, EKS, and Terraform.</p>
              <p>I like EDA for its high availability and eventual consistency. This makes a system efficient even when scaling it.</p>

Following this, each iteration undergoes a rigorous review, ensuring precision and catching errors before they surface. Expert coding techniques are then employed, implementing robust solutions using cutting-edge technologies. This process is not linear; it&apos;s a constant loop of iterative refinement, where your feedback shapes the ongoing enhancements. Finally, the result is a seamless deployment, bringing your project to life with precision, passion, and a commitment to excellence.</p>*/}
